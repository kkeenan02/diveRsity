Title: A Comprehensive, General Purpose Population Genetics Analysis Package
Author: Kevin Keenan <kkeenan02@qub.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Kevin Keenan <kkeenan02@qub.ac.uk>
Description: Allows the calculation of both genetic diversity partition 
  statistics, genetic differentiation statistics, and locus informativeness 
  for ancestry assignment. 
  It also provides users with various option to calculate 
  bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals both across loci, 
  for pairwise population comparisons, and to plot these results interactively. 
  Parallel computing capabilities and pairwise results without 
  bootstrapping are rovided. 
  Weir and Cockerham's 1984 F-statistics are also calculated. 
  Various plotting features are also provided, as well as Chi-square tests of 
  genetic heterogeneity are also provided. 
  Functionality for the calculation of various diversity parameters is 
  possible for RAD-seq derived SNP data sets containing thousands of marker loci.
  A shiny application for the development of microsatellite multiplexes is 
  also available.
